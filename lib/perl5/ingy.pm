=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use perl5-ingy;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Using this module is the same as:

    use 5.010;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use IO::All;

This is an early release. More modules will be added as this framework
matures.

=head1 STATUS

This module is brand new. Don't use it. I wouldn't if I were you. But I'm not
you. I'm Ingy. This module is name after me. You are not Ingy. This module is
not named after you. iykwimaittydrotflmaowtfbbqftwkthxbai.
